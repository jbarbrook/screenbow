Rayyan Macros .LUA scripts for the Pimoroni Keybow

https://photos.app.goo.gl/DsgtLwcERejJ74r77

The present 'working ok!' layout is included in the screnbow.lua file. 

This is a macro to map shortcuts in rayyan.ai to keys on the Pimoroni Keybow to get round the issue that using macro software and other quality of life applications on University PCs usually is not permitted.

Three top buttons are mapped to the close browser window and two 'magic buttons'. If you don't have a complete abstract, highlight the title in rayyan and press the button. It will open the title in either google scholar or lancaster university onesearch using the google chrome browser, which more than likely contain a complete title and abstract.

To prevent desktop browser clutter, press the close browser button to exit that browser instance. 

To Do

Create a mac and linux version

To Install

Drop the screenbow file in the layouts folder
Add require "layouts/screenbow" to the bottom of the keys file
